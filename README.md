# football_upcoming_matches

HI , I am Hardik Saraswat . 
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this assignment . 

In this project I have made frontend to display the data , and backend to call the sports api 
API URL = https://api.football-data.org/v4/matches
I got this URL from : https://www.football-data.org/

As I was getting cors error that is why i decided to make a backend server by which i can resolve the cors issue .

If you are running this code , here are the dependencies that you will have to install , although they are already in the package.json so you just have to write 
"npm i "  but stil here are the dependencies : cors , axios , tailwindcss .
